                Hello, my name is <em>Evan</em>! Some things about me are that I like going on bike rides and recording videos. I bike with an electric bike, it can go a maximum of <strong>40kmh</strong>! The bike route I ride the most goes all the way from Kanata to Tunneys Pasture. Its a very beautiful bike ride that goes alongside the Ottawa River and through the Green Belt. When I take that route I usually stay at my friends house to let my bike charge since the battery is pretty low at that point.

                Sometimes I like to combine my two hobbies of video making and biking and will attatch my go pro to my chest as I bike the route. Its fun because occasionally there will be funny or interesting moments and I like looking back at them. In conclusion, biking in Ottawa can be pretty beautiful, and pairing it with a camera can be pretty entertaining.
